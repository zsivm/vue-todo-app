# Vue-todo-app
This is a todo app programmed in vue.js
The app will be able to handle multiple todo lists, have proper login, use firebase for data storage and ux will be polished.

The first scope is to have multiple lists, which contain themed todo tasks, which can be added completed and removed, storage is localStorage based.
UX is not priority in this scope.
